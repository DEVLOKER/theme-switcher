# Dark Light Mode Switcher

Chrome extension that can switch a webpage between dark and light modes. This can be particularly useful for users who prefer reading in a dark mode but visit websites that don’t have built-in support for it.

**the idea**
To switch between themes, I employed the CSS `filter: invert`. This approach is a bit of a hack, but it effectively inverts the colors on the page, which approximates a dark mode effect. While it’s not always produce perfect results, especially on complex pages. It might affect images and certain elements in unintended ways.

# Building the Extension

To build the extension, run the following command: `npm run build`
This command triggers Vite to compile and bundle the extension's code, generating the output files in the dist folder.

# Testing

To test the extension in Chrome, follow these steps:

1. Open Chrome and go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
2. Enable `"Developer mode"` by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
3. Click on the `"Load unpacked"` button.
4. Select the dist folder that was generated by the build process.
   This will load the unpacked extension into Chrome, allowing you to test its functionality directly in the browser.
